## chess_dictionary_validator.py

# Write a function named is_valid_chess_board() that takes a dictionary argument and returns True or False
# depending on if the board is valid.
# A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king. Each player can only have
# at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all pieces must be on a valid space from '1a' to '8h';
# that is, a piece canâ€™t be on space '9z'. The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to represent
# white or black, followed by 'pawn', 'knight', 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', or 'king'.
# This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess board.
